### Hello, welcome to my profile :house:

I'm a very curious Chemistry Engineer :mortar_board: who love learning new things and getting the larger amount of information possible about everything :microscope:
    
I'm in love with Data Science :chart_with_upwards_trend: and I'm starting to run some codes and making my first analysis :blush:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on deploying a Machine Learning Model
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning API's deploy and Cloud Services
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you want, except football (Vasco and United are not doing so well right now)
- :computer: Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/luanrdutra/
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'll simply say "Ah cara" for almost everything and I actually enjoy to listen some :musical_keyboard: and watch :tennis:
- :sunny: I'm very interest about new sources of energy, mainly Solar Photovoltaics, which was the theme of my graduation asset
